    <h1>Welcome to Seville</h1>
    <h2>city in Southern Spain</h2>
    <p>
      Seville: A City Forged by Time Seville is a city shaped by centuries of
      history, legends, and conquests. Believed to be founded by Hercules or the
      Turdetani tribe, it passed through the hands of Phoenicians, Greeks,
      Carthaginians, and Romans—who named it Iulia Romula. After the fall of
      Rome, Visigoths and later Muslims took over, renaming it Isbiliyya. The
      Almohad period saw Seville flourish, with iconic structures like the
      Giralda and Torre del Oro. Conquered in 1248 by King Ferdinand III, the
      city became a key Castilian capital. The 16th century brought
      architectural splendor, though economic decline followed. In the 19th and
      20th centuries, Seville endured revolts, war, and disaster, but rose again
      with the 1992 World Expo. Today, it stands proud as Andalusia’s
      capital—vibrant, historical, and ever-evolving.
